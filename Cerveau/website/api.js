     * @apiDescription When given a gameName and session id, responds with json data about what is going on in that game session, including what clients are connected.
     * @apiParam {String} gameName      The name of the game (or an alias), must be a valid game on the server.
     * @apiParam {String} gameSession   The session id of the game you want to check the status of.
     *
     * @apiSuccess {String} gameName                    The actual name of the game, e.g. "chess" -> "Chess".
     * @apiSuccess {String} gameSession                 The id of the session in that game.
     * @apiSuccess {String} gamelogFilename             The filename (id) of the gamelog. To get the actual gamelog use the /gamelog/:id part of the API. null means the gamelog does not exist yet because it is still being written to the filesystem
     * @apiSuccess {String} status                      What the status of this game session is:
     *  * "empty" if the game session is valid, but does not exist because no clients have ever connected to it.
     *  * "open" if the game session has had a least 1 client connect, but the game has not started.
     *  * "running" if all players have connected, and the game is actively in progress, but not over.
     *  * "over" if the game session has ran to completion and clients have disconnected.
     *  * "error" otherwise, such as if the gameName was invalid.
     * @apiSuccess {Number} numberOfPlayers         The number of clients that are playing needed to connect to make the game session start running.
     * @apiSuccess {Client[]} clients               An array of clients currently in that game session.
     *
     * @apiSuccess (Client) {Number} [index]            If the player requested, or was assigned, a player index. When a game session reaches "running" this will be set.
     * @apiSuccess (Client) {String} name               The name of the client.
     * @apiSuccess (Client) {Boolean} spectating        If the client is a spectator (not a playing client). Spectators will not have indexes.
     * @apiSuccess (Client) {Boolean} [disconnected]    If the client disconnected unexpectedly during the game.
     * @apiSuccess (Client) {Boolean} [timedOut]          If the client timedOut and we were forced to disconnect them during the game.
     * @apiSuccess (Client) {Boolean} [won]             If the player won this will be set, and be true.
     * @apiSuccess (Client) {Boolean} [lost]            If the player lost this will be set, and be true.
     * @apiSuccess (Client) {String} [reason]           If the player won or lost this will be the human readable reason why they did so.
