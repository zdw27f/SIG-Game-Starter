# website/

This should contain all the code and files needed for the Cerveau website (web interface) to work. In a tradditional NodeJS project this all might be considered the 'app', but given Cerveau servces web browsers and game clients we have cleared up the differences between this website/ directory and the gameplay/ directory.

Do not duplicate code. If anything code needs to be shared between the web and game services consider moving it to `../utilities/`.
